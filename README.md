# Swiggy_casestudy_SQL
📊 Swiggy Sales Analysis Using SQL (Star Schema Implementation)
Project Overview

Designed and implemented an end-to-end Swiggy Sales Analysis solution using SQL by building a star schema data model consisting of fact and dimension tables. The project involved transforming raw CSV data into structured analytical tables to enable scalable, high-performance querying and business insights.

## Data Modelling and Table Design:
- Created a Fact Table (fact_swiggy_orders) to store order-level transactional metrics such as price, rating, and rating count.
- Designed and populated Dimension Tables:
- dim_date (date hierarchy: year, month, quarter, week)
- dim_location (state, city, area)
- dim_restaurant (restaurant details)
- dim_category (food category)
- dim_dish (dish-level details)
